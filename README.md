# capstone-project-4
The public API used for this project is from the Metropolitan Museum of Art Collection API.

This Captone Project (#4) was completed on a ten-year old laptop running Windows 8.1.

**Instructions**

Start up your Git Bash or Windows PowerShell.

Run npm install (or npm i) to install Express, EJS, and Axios.

Remember to add "type": "module", to your package.json if you haven't already done so, or if you get any error messages about this ommission.

Start the server using node index.js or nodemon index.js.

The interface features an ID field with four buttons. These are all GET routes. Click on the first three to see the results in the Response Area (the grey box at the top).

To search for an object by ID, type a number in the ID field.

There are over 40,000 entries in the Collection so the Response Area will expand to hold the results of your search.
